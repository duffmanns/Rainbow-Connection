# Rainbow Connection
This script uses python image library to get color info about an image.
We then find the most used colors and return their names along with complementary colors

# How to run
I have used PycharmCE to develop and execute, but simple double clicking getcolor.py should work on machines with python installed.

Install python 2.7 if not installed already.
Add python to your path if not there
(Mac) If you don't have pip installed do a 'sudo easy_install pip'
Install PIL by typing 'pip install pillow' from the command line
Install webcolors by typing 'pip install webcolors' from the command line

'python ./getcolor.py' from terminal

User is asked for an image to scan. You can type blue_white_dot.png for a demo
